# 4SP MAX

**4SP Max** is the next-generation, evolutionary enhancement of the renowned **4SP** platform. While the original 4SP is designed for static efficiency, 4SP Max is a high-powered deployment for those who need a range of integrated tools, a professional interface, and unhindered access to restricted networks.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i> Vern: Advanced Proxy

The backbone of the Max platform. *Vern* is a dynamic proxy that circumvents network restrictions in a more reliable way than static proxies.

*   **Optimized Protocol**: Built for speed and low-latency browsing.
*   **Auto-Failover**: Automatically disables on static `*.github.io` URLs to prevent breaking the user interface.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i> Velium: Integrated Music

An integrated music player that eliminates the need to open external tabs. *Note: This feature is currently available to select users.*

*   **Background Playback**: Listen to music while you use other tools or play games.
*   **UI Integration**: Matches the sleek, dark design scheme of the platform.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-tv"></i> Vora: Media & Movies

*   **Sleek Library View**: A clean interface designed to display large content libraries.
*   **Optimized Player**: Engineered for minimal buffering, even on restricted school networks.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-robot"></i> Vana: AI Chatbot

A personal AI collaborator integrated into the dashboard.

## UI & Design Philosophy

4SP Max isn’t just a product—it’s a design upgrade.

*   **Professional & Minimalist**: A "locked-in" dark theme inspired by Vercel and modern development environments.
*   **Geist Typography**: Uses Geist and Inter fonts to provide an elegant, premium look.
*   **Dynamic Layout**: A redesigned user interface with a focus on organization and usability.
