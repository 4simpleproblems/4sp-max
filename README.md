# 4SP Max

**4SP Max** is the advanced, dynamic evolution of the 4SP platform. While the original was built for static efficiency, **Max** is a high-armor deployment designed for users who require a full suite of integrated tools, professional UI, and unblocked access across restricted networks.

---

## The V-Suite Ecosystem

4SP Max introduces the **V-Suite**, a collection of interconnected apps built to handle everything from media consumption to AI-driven workflows.

### 🌐 Vern: Advanced Proxy

The backbone of the Max platform. **Vern** is a dynamic proxy system that bypasses restrictions with higher reliability than traditional static unblockers.

* **Dynamic Routing**: Requires a dynamic host like Vercel or Railway.
* **Protocol**: Optimized for speed and low-latency browsing.
* **Auto-Failover**: Automatically disables on static `*.github.io` URLs to prevent breaking the UI.

### 🎵 Velium: Integrated Music

A fully integrated music player that eliminates the need for external tabs or "ass" music platforms.

* **Background Playback**: Listen while you navigate other tools or games.
* **UI Integration**: Matches the sleek, dark-themed aesthetic of the platform.

### 🎬 Vora: Media & Movies

The "Movie App" built for the inner circle. **Vora** provides a curated library for high-quality streaming during "Snow Day" maintenance windows.

* **Sleek Library View**: Organized for large content libraries.
* **Optimized Player**: Minimal buffering, even on restricted school networks.

### 🤖 Vana: AI Chatbot

Your personal AI collaborator integrated directly into the dashboard.

* **Social & Dev Assistant**: Use **Vana** to debug code or model social variables in real-time.
* **Dynamic Response**: Powered by advanced LLM backends for a grounded, authentic experience.

## UI & Design Philosophy

4SP Max isn't just a tool; it's an aesthetic upgrade.

* **Professional Minimalist**: A "locked-in" dark theme inspired by Vercel and modern dev environments.
* **Geist Typography**: Uses Geist and Inter fonts for a sleek, high-end feel.
* **Dynamic Layout**: A redesigned interface that prioritizes organization and scannability.
